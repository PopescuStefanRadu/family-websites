CMS Menu
========

Drupal module for CMS Main Menu and CMS User Menu

Front-end menu

There is a problem exporting basic-pages with Feature - it doesen't export the URL alias, but the path to the node (nid)
Use module menu_import for export-import links from a menu. Before importing the menu, please make sure you have all the basic pages and views required, with the correct alias (Otherwise, the menu link will be set to /)
